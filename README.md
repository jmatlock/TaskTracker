## Task Tracker

Web app for encouraging completion of tasks.

**This project is part of a #100DaysOfCode challenge!**

This Python Django project collects a repository of tasks which need to be completed, and allows the user
to log their progress. Additionally, when the user enters the app, they will be offered 3 random tasks which
may help motivate them to consider for their next work item.

### To be done for MVP version 1:
- [ ] Setup data models :construction:
- [ ] Allow the user to provide icons for the tasks
- [ ] CRUD for all data
- [ ] Initially provide standard forms for data entry
- [ ] Subsequently provide custom styled web pages 
- [ ] Include "random task" functionality
- [ ] Style with Bootstrap or Material Design
